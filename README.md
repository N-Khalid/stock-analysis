# Stock Analysis

## Project Overview
Steve has asked us to analyze stocks that his parents have began investing in. The purpose of this analysis is to provide historical stock analysis for several stocks to provide the best stocks for Steve's parents to invest into.

### Results

Results: Our analysis shows that as a whole, the performance of the tickers we're tracking were excellent in 2017 while most were quite poor in 2018. Based on the results shown below, I would recommend Steve's parents invest into ENPH as it has shown incredible performance year over year.

The execution of the original script was outpaced by the refactored script we ran. Shown below compares both the 2017 and 2018 pre-refactored script versus the refactored ones

## Summary:
  The advantages of refactoring code are:
    1) The code is made more efficient and so the analysis can be done quicker
    2) The code being continually improved on means there are potentially less bugs in the final product and the analysis is further understood
  The disadvantages of refacoring code are:
  1) It takes more time to refactor and so your analysis may be delayed
  2) It may be redundent as the analysis already takes a negligible amount of time before refactoring
  
  These pros and cons apply to the orignal VBA script because we were able to understand our script better therefore being able to manipulate it further to make it more effiecent. The other side to this is that the script already took next to no time to finish and refactoring it did not provide much of an upside.
